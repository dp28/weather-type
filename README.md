# weather-type

A library for comparing and averaging weather type strings.

# Why

Various weather APIs provide some form of 'weather type' description, eg 'clear'
or 'light rain'. This library parses these into objects that can be compared and
combined, for example to enable averaging multiple weather types.

# Install

```
npm install weather-type
